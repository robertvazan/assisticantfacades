# Assisticant.Facades #

**UNMAINTAINED**: This library is no longer maintained, because I rarely use Windows these days. It has not been updated in years. You are welcome to adopt the library if you find it useful.

This library enables you to use [Assisticant](https://assisticant.net/) within custom WPF controls. It makes it a breeze to implement controls with complex behavior and computed properties.
